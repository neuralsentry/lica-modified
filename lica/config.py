Filter definitions.

This is my shoddy implementation for filtering commits base
on keywords:
- The key for the dictionary acts as a category,
used in statistcs,
- Each dictonary value is a list containing keywords you want
to filter for,
- Such that a commit containing (in title or body) any of the
keywords in any of the lists will be a hit

If the value is a list, the values are all concatenated into one ugly
regex to be matched against the commit text. For a string value, it's treated as
a sane regular expression and used that way (see filter_commit() in helpers.py)

If this is used in "message_filter" (see below), it will select
a commit containing keyword. However, if it's used in "message_ignore",
it will ignore the commit with any keyword.

Below are some super simple example to demonstrate some usecases for the filter
"system", they won't necessary generate useful results though.

Configuration definitions.

This configurations determines how Lica filters commits,
and any local kernel source trees you want to check for patches:
- @title_filter: regex used to intially filter commits by their title, done first
- @message_ignore: a filter dictionary (see above comment) by which to ignore commits on match,
  this is done before message_filter, so takes precedence
- @message_filter: a filter dictionary (see above comment) by which to accept commits on match,
- @reporter_filter: filter commits by a specific reporter (from Reported-By tag)
- @coverage_list: paths to kernel sources you want to compare commit patches against, this should be a path
  to a kernel source ROOT (containing mm/, net/, fs/ etc. etc.)
